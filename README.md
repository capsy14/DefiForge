# Alternate_Implementation of SFS->
 ## Centralisation Problem in SFS->
  - In the realm of blockchain collaboration, the Sequencer Fee Sharing (SFS) contract holds the promise of equitable revenue distribution. However, a critical drawback surfacesâ€”a one-person rule. Currently, only a single developer can seize the opportunity to register their project, consolidating exclusive control over the entire earnings pool. It's akin to attending a concert where only one artist graces the stage, monopolizing the spotlight.

  - This limitation hinders the collaborative spirit and inclusive ethos essential for shared ownership and mutual success. The SFS is inadvertently staging a solo performance, excluding valuable contributors from the revenue-sharing spotlight.

## Decentralised Solution: Transforming SFS Contracts for Collaborative Success->
In the updated Sequencer Fee Sharing (SFS) contract, We've tackled the centralization issue with a more collaborative and inclusive approach:

- **Multiple Developers Registration**: Now, multiple developers can register their smart contracts simultaneously, fostering a shared ownership structure.

- **Individual Revenue Shares**: Developers can specify their unique share in revenue fees during registration, ensuring fairness and acknowledging diverse contributions.
- **Flexible Assignment and Withdrawal**: Many Developers can dynamically register their contracts using pre-assigned NFT and withdraw earned fees, enhancing flexibility.
- **Proportional Fee Distribution**: The distributeFees function proportionally distributes fees based on specified shares, promoting fair revenue allocation.

This evolution empowers developers to actively contribute, share ownership, and enjoy fair revenue distribution in collaborative blockchain projects.
