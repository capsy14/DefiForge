## Overview

EventModePass signifies a paradigm shift in event management. Event creators can effortlessly list their events on our platform, featuring dynamic event generation powered by our innovative `Event_Registration_Factory` smart contract. This generates a dedicated `Event_contract` owned by the Event Manager, and registering these contracts on the SFS (Sequencer Fee Sharing) empowers both Event Managers and Developers, ensuring a fair revenue share from the SFS contract.

User participation is elevated through the acquisition of NFTs, contributing to our groundbreaking revenue-sharing model. Each transaction allocates a percentage to the SFS Fee Contract, ensuring a seamless and transparent distribution of funds to both the Event Manager and Developer. Beyond mere event access, NFT holders are bestowed with a prestigious token, offering the potential for increased market value post-event.

EventModePass establishes a symbiotic relationship, where Event Managers and Developers reap substantial revenue rewards, and users gain access to exclusive event experiences while holding valuable NFT assets.
