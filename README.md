Smart contracts, fueled by MODE's Sequencer Fee Sharing (SFS), make events dynamic and financially rewarding for all. Forget jargon; it's about excitement for everyoneâ€”organizers, developers, and party people. With cool NFTs offering VIP access and unique ownership, DefiForge pioneers an NFT marketplace. Join us, where events aren't just moments; they're unforgettable experiences with opportunities that linger long after the party ends!ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰


## Key Features:

2. **Seamless Revenue Sharing with SFS:**  Leverage the power of the SFS (Sequencer Fee Sharing) contract to ensure transparent and fair revenue distribution to Event Managers and Developers.

   - **For Developers:** As the owner of the `Event_Registration_Factory` contract, receive revenue shares from the SFS contract whenever an event is registered.

   - **For Event Creators:** As the owner of the `Event_contract` contract, receive revenue shares from the SFS contract whenever NFT tickets are sold.

# Alternate_Implementation of SFS->
 ## Centralisation Problem in SFS->
  - In the realm of blockchain collaboration, the Sequencer Fee Sharing (SFS) contract holds the promise of equitable revenue distribution. However, a critical drawback surfacesâ€”a one-person rule. Currently, only a single developer can seize the opportunity to register their project, consolidating exclusive control over the entire earnings pool. It's akin to attending a concert where only one artist graces the stage, monopolizing the spotlight.

  - This limitation hinders the collaborative spirit and inclusive ethos essential for shared ownership and mutual success. The SFS is inadvertently staging a solo performance, excluding valuable contributors from the revenue-sharing spotlight.

# Conclusion:
  Concluding DefiForge, we invite you to join us in redefining the future of events. From dynamic creation with smart contracts to seamless revenue sharing and an NFT marketplace, DefiForge is not just an event platformâ€”it's a revolutionary journey. Together, let's transcend the ordinary, creating unforgettable moments and unlocking opportunities that linger long after the lights dim. Embrace innovation, experience exclusivity, and step into a new era of events with DefiForgeâ€”where every gathering becomes a legendary celebration! ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰
